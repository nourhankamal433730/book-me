                <h4>About The Author</h4>
                <p>
                    Ramsey Campbell (born 4 January 1946) is an English horror fiction writer, editor and critic who has been writing for well over fifty years. He is the author of over 30 novels and hundreds of short stories, many of them winners of literary awards. Three of his novels have been adapted into films.<br><br>
                    Since he first came to prominence in the mid-1960s, critics have cited Campbell as one of the leading writers in his field: T. E. D. Klein has written that "Campbell reigns supreme in the field today", and Robert Hadji has described him as "perhaps the finest living exponent of the British weird fiction tradition", while S. T. Joshi stated, "future generations will regard him as the leading horror writer of our generation, every bit the equal of Lovecraft or Blackwood." In a 2021 appreciation of his collected works, The Washington Post said, "taken together, they constitute one of the monumental accomplishments of modern popular fiction."

                <h4>About The Book</h4>
                <p>
                    The most powerful emotion in our reality is LOVE. The most formidable human instinct is the sexual drive. Some unions are conceived in Heaven; some are devised in hell. Kyate, Master of the Deis Warriors, has been deployed by the Galactic Council of Deis to command the Deis fleet and protect the carrier of a "special gene" Kyate, Master of the Deis Warriors, and spiritual teacher in his own right, had been deployed by the Galactic Council of Deis to command the Deis fleet and protect the carrier of the god seed. The Province of Ulonica, on the planet Earth, was under siege. The Alicupions and the Drothuarians were battling for control of the planet, by securing the only pure Benjai DNA remaining -- The Princess Zeidra. Kyate was first a spiritual master; and secondly he was a warrior monk; but his true identity was known only to one mortal. Kyate’s passionate obsession with Zeidra is nearly his ruination; and he almost destroys her.

                        Many of my friends recommended me this book, therefore, I finally decided to give it a read. Unfortunately, there aren't any book shops around where I live so this website proved to be of a great help. I was easily able to access this book. Thank you so much!
