                    Joshua Dalzelle is an American science-fiction writer known for his fast-paced and action-packed novels. According to my search results, he has written **25 books** in total, including the Omega Force series, Black Fleet Trilogy, Expansion Wars Trilogy, Terran Scout Fleet series, and Unification War Trilogy. You can find a comprehensive list of his books in order of publication at.

                <h4>About The Book</h4>
                <p>
                    This is Book 1 of the Black Fleet Trilogy. I liked it, I think it was a solid entry into a new trilogy. Starts out a bit slow with a paced build to the opening conflict of what promises to be a serious knock down drag out. Solid character development throughout the entirety of the book which leaves the author plenty of room to dial up the action in the next book. I would recommend this book to readers but go in knowing its a trilogy and there's much more to come.<br><br>Sad:<br>
                    Well-written hardcore military sci-fi yarn, but somewhat oversimplified perhaps. The protagonist was very well written, but the other characters were given short shrift. The main plot was interesting, but the intense focus on the main (high-stress) plot was tiring at times. A smaller subplot arc, perhaps centering on Pike, would've added color and complexity.<br><br>Goodthelife<br>
                    This book is about leadership, not needing to be friends with anyone below (but still having some) creativity in finding solutions in the face of impossible odds enabled by knowing the system better than anyone else and leveraging ideas from the crew and never, ever giving up.<br>
                    It's also about bias, and doing the right thing in spite of this.
                    In fact, it's about ignoring everything, including politics, career, and even saving his own life, for the sake of doing the right thing. And in the end, truly making a difference.

                        Many of my friends recommended me this book, therefore, I finally decided to give it a read. Unfortunately, there aren't any book shops around where I live so this website proved to be of a great help. I was easily able to access this book. Thank you so much!
