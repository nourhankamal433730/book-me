                        I’ve always been a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, and this book did not let me know. I will say, it was very different than his normal style in some ways- however I was here for it and loved how he crafted the writing to be a new style for him. It also had me trying to figure out possible scenarios to the story and was so happy with how it all flowed together. I didn’t expect to cry on the literal last 5 sentences but it was the perfect place and ending. Do not sleep on this novel!

                        I love Nicholas Sparks but this one fell flat. There were two story lines. One a young man on vacation with a passion for music falls in love and the other story line a woman who is fleeing her abusive husband with her young son. The romance one didn’t pull me in but was pulled in with the woman’s story. Then the stories intersect and I was surprised with how. I was disappointed we only got to see the ending from his point of view. I really wanted to see in her head after everything happened. This is my least favorite of his books.

                        Really enjoyed reading all of nicholas sparks novels specially first five of them BUT this one didn't hit the spot.... There seems something missing or the realtionship between main characters is more narrative than the actual time they spend and enjoyed together. The deep feeling or connection and in between the lines understanding is not as in previous novels .
